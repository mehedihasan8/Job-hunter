        <h4 className="my-4 font-semibold">
          A custom hook is a function that uses one or more of React's built-in
          hooks (such as useState, useEffect, etc.) to encapsulate and reuse
          component logic.
        </h4>
        <p className="my-2">
          # Custom hooks follow the naming convention of starting with "use" and
          can use any built-in hooks or other custom hooks inside them.
        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          # Custom hooks allow you to abstract away complex logic into reusable
          functions, which makes your code more readable and maintainable.
        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          # Custom hooks can be shared between different components without
          duplicating code, which reduces code redundancy and makes it easier to
          update.

        </h4>
        <p className="my-2 md:w-11/12">
          # useRef is a hook in React that returns a reference object, which can
          be used to hold a mutable value that persists across renders. The
          useRef hook can be used to access and manipulate DOM elements, store
          previous values of a state, or store any other mutable data that needs
          to persist across renders. The reference object returned by useRef has
          a current property that can be read or updated directly, without
          causing the component to re-render.

          Here are simply explain what is `useMemo`...
        </h4>
        <p className="my-2 md:w-11/12">
          # useMemo is a React hook that allows to memoize the result of a
          function call and cache it for later use. It helps optimize
          performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations or re-renders of
          components. The hook takes two arguments: a function that performs the
          expensive calculation and an array of dependencies that the function
          depends on. The function is only executed when at least one of the
          dependencies has changed. If none of the dependencies have changed,
          the cached result is returned instead.
